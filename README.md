Note: This has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. If you would like to use it on a distro other than Ubuntu or a version greater than 18.04, you can make Asahi work by changing the minimum TLS version in the nginx config (to my belief atleast).
Note 2: In the rare case you edit the packet reader/writer, you will need to rebuild the cython files upon any edits. You can find instructions further below on how to build them if you do change it.

## Auto Setup

I have written an install script to make the install process easier. Note that this is untested and may have errors and if so, please report them!
To add to this I'd like to note I added this for ease of install, and you will still be expected to have atleast basic linux and python knowledge. I am willing to help people who face troubles but if you are coming to me with a lack of common sense/knowledge, I probably won't help you.

To run the script:

```bash
chmod +x ext/install.sh
./ext/install.sh
```

## Manual Setup

First install any requirements:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa # for python 3.9
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.9 python3.9-dev python3.9-distutils nginx build-essential certbot mariadb-server redis-server
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python3.9 get-pip.py && rm get-pip.py
python3.9 -m pip install -r ext/requirements.txt
git submodule init && git submodule update
```

You can find the database structure in ext/db.sql, you may want to import that before you advance: `mariadb -u username -p database < ext/db.sql` (replace username and database as necessary)

Now, edit your nginx config (found in ext/nginx.conf), here we will generate the certificate for your nginx config and reload:
```bash
sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns --email your@email.com --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-tos -d *.your.domain -d your.domain # change your.domain & email to your own
sudo ln ext/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/asahi.conf # make a link between nginx folder and asahi's folder so you can easy edit the config as needed
sudo nginx -s reload # reload nginx config
```

Now, copy the config file and edit the config:
```bash
cp ext/config.sample.py config.py
```

Finally, start up Asahi:
```bash
./main.py
```
